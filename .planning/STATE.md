# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-10)

**Core value:** Il giocatore di ruolo non distoglie mai lo sguardo dalla scena fisica.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Validation Gates

## Current Position

Phase: 0 (Validation Gates) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4 (next: closure — execute 6 hardware tests + MidiQOL probe in real hardware/Foundry, populate ADR-0005 verdict + ADR-0006 conditional, INV-3 doc cycle)
Status: Plan 03 complete; Plan 04 gated on Even Hub developer access grant (hardware tests) + 3 RF env physical setup + camera capture + Foundry test world (MidiQOL probe re-run)
Last activity: 2026-05-10 -- Phase 0 Plan 03 complete (2 tasks, 9 files including upng-js.d.ts ambient declaration; all 6 hardware scripts type-check green at TS strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess; Pattern 3 capability-negotiation skip uniform across all 6 scripts; T-00-03 verified zero network introspection API calls)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: 43 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 0 | 3 | 43 min | 14 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- 2026-05-10 — Phase 0 Plan 03 (6 hardware test scripts pre-grant scaffold): ~25 min, 9 files, 3 commits (15e9922 absorbed Task 1 / 3b2578d Task 2 / 8670b0c fix-up), tsc green at exit 0, smoke run all 6 → exit 2 (Pattern 3 skip uniform).
- 2026-05-10 — Phase 0 Plan 02 (MidiQOL probe + run-all orchestrator): 11 min, 6 files, 2 task commits (15e9922 / c1c82e5), tsc green at exit 0, smoke run exits 2 (within plan-acceptable 0/2 range).
- 2026-05-10 — Phase 0 Plan 01 (test infrastructure scaffolding): 7 min, 16 files, 3 commits (40732fe / f301aaf / 96f4c85), type-check green at exit 0.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 0 (pre-planning): Specs.md v0.9.11 §10 plan adopted verbatim with 4 research-SUMMARY adjustments (Phase 0 scope expansion, Phase 4 split, CONN pulled forward to Phase 2, INV-5 ratification at Phase 6, Phase 10 field-test extension).
- Phase 0 (pre-planning): MidiQOL declared *required* for MVP (`relationships.requires` in module.json) — without `autoFastForward` mode, manual writes stall on chat-card buttons.
- Phase 0 (pre-planning): Phase 4 carries 6 of 17 research pitfalls — highest risk concentration; allocated 4 weeks split into 4a (weeks 4-5) + 4b (weeks 6-7) instead of monolithic 4 weeks.
- Phase 0 (pre-planning): Single-workflow-origin discipline option A (`socketlib.executeAsGM` only; player client never invokes `activity.use()` directly) — locked for Phase 7 (research Pitfall 6).
- Phase 0 Plan 01 deviation: TypeScript pinned at `5.8.3` (latest 5.8 stable on npm) instead of plan-cited `5.8.5` — `5.8.5` does not exist on npm registry. STACK.md and CLAUDE.md "TypeScript 5.8.5" references should be corrected to `5.8.3` in next INV-3 cross-cutting commit.
- Phase 0 Plan 01 deviation: pnpm tooling at `10.33.4` (latest-10 dist-tag) instead of cited `10.3.1` (does not exist on npm). Affects only global tooling, not committed package.json.
- Phase 0 Plan 02 decision: REQ MIDIQ-01 production module declaration (`relationships.requires.midi-qol` in `evfoundryvtt` `module.json`) shape proven via probe mini-module — Phase 2 production module inherits identically. Probe code complete; evidence emission pending operational execution against Foundry test world (Plan 04 closure step).
- Phase 0 Plan 02 decision: T-00-02 read-only contract enforced by literal grep gate (`grep -c "game.settings.set" probe.js` MUST return 0) instead of relying on code review — verifiable in CI.
- Phase 0 Plan 02 decision: explicit per-branch `process.exit(0/1/2)` calls (instead of ternary expression) so static literal greps for each exit code all match — accommodates plan-defined acceptance gates and future CI grep checks.
- Phase 0 Plan 03 decision: upng-js@2.1.0 ambient module declaration moved to standalone `tests/phase-0/upng-js.d.ts` since inline `declare module` was rejected by TypeScript with TS2665 ("Invalid module name in augmentation. Module 'upng-js' resolves to an untyped module"). Standalone .d.ts files are picked up by tsconfig include='**/*.ts' globbing.
- Phase 0 Plan 03 decision: skip-case payloads use `1` for all `z.number().int().positive()` schema fields (sessions, samples_per_gesture, duration_sec, initial_mtu_bytes, iterations) — semantic "no measurement performed" sentinel; the `verdict: "skipped"` field carries the operational signal. Avoids 0-rejection by Zod's `positive()` constraint.
- Phase 0 Plan 03 decision: Task 1 deliverables (10-0-7/8/9 + package.json upng-js add) bundled into Plan 02 commit `15e9922` due to parallel Wave 1 execution sharing the `tests/phase-0/` working tree. Plan 04 closure must reference 3 commits for full Plan 03 history (15e9922 + 3b2578d + 8670b0c). Documented in 00-03-SUMMARY.md Deviations §5.
- Phase 0 Plan 03 decision: `tests/phase-0/.gitignore` extended with `docs/` to exclude runtime evidence written when scripts execute with cwd=tests/phase-0/ (smoke testing); real evidence under repo-root `docs/perf/phase-0/` when Plan 04 runs scripts from repo root.

### Pending Todos

- INV-3 doc-coherence cycle: align STACK.md + CLAUDE.md TypeScript pin from `5.8.5` → `5.8.3` and pnpm pin from `10.3.1` → `10.33.4` (verifiable via `npm view`).

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 0 hardware access dependency:** Even Hub developer access required for §10.0.1-10.0.9 tests. Timeline estimate: 1-2 weeks request → grant. Tracks to Phase 0 entry.
- **Phase 0 Branch A/B/C decision gates everything:** §10.0.5 binary decision tree must produce ADR-0005 before Phase 1 applicative code. Branch C (glyph-only) would defer raster pipeline to Phase 13 stretch and reshape Phase 4a/4b scope significantly.
- **Research-flagged Phase 7 open questions (Specs §12.B q.11-12, q.15):** MidiQOL `completeActivityUse` signature + Fighter Extra Attack route (`activity.use({count: 2})` vs client-loop) need empirical verification — gate on Phase 7 entry.
